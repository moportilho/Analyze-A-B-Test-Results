# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
Udacity project for Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by us, data analysts, and data scientists. It's important for us to get some practice working with the difficulties of these tests.

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page with the goal of increasing the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for our product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help our company understand whether we should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make an informed decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files I need to complete the project, are provided in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab (as well as under "Supporting Materials" below). I understand that portions of the notebook might reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure I'm on the right track.
